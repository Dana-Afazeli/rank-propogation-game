*Generated on 2025-08-06 13:32:59*  
*Based on 36,000 simulation runs*

## Executive Summary

This comprehensive empirical study examines rank-propagation dynamics across 36,000 simulations on random networks. We systematically varied network size (n∈[20, 50, 100, 150, 200]), ranking complexity (m∈[5, 8, 10, 12, 15]), and edge density (p∈[0.05, 0.1, 0.2, 0.3, 0.5, 0.7]), comparing asynchronous vs synchronous update mechanisms.

**Key Findings:**
- **Asynchronous dynamics:** All asynchronous runs converged to fixed points.
- **Convergence scaling:** Power-law relationships with density-dependent exponents
- **Synchronous fragility:** 35 parameter combinations showed <50% convergence
- **Consensus levels:** Async 0.956, Sync 0.939

## Detailed Plot Analysis & Implications

### 1. Asynchronous Convergence CDFs
**What it shows:** Distribution of convergence times for each (n,p) combination  
**Data-driven insights:** Fastest convergence: n=20, p=0.7 (median 74 updates). Slowest: n=200, p=0.05 (median 2174 updates). This reveals that 0.7 density is optimal for size 20, while 0.1 density struggles with size 200.

### 2. Synchronous Convergence Heatmap  
**What it shows:** Fraction of runs that converged for each parameter combination  
**Data-driven insights:** Most fragile: n=20, p=0.05 (0.0% convergence). Most robust: n=50, p=0.5 (100.0% convergence). Large sparse networks are particularly vulnerable to synchronous cycles.

### 3. Consensus Analysis
**What it shows:** Distribution of consensus levels across all conditions  
**Data-driven insights:** Optimal density for consensus: p=0.7 (0.999 average). Worst: p=0.05 (0.824). Network connectivity is crucial - too sparse prevents coordination, but diminishing returns at high density.

## Complete Empirical Question Analysis

### Q1: Asynchronous Convergence Certainty
**Question:** Does asynchronous updating ever fail to converge?

**Answer:** All asynchronous runs converged to fixed points.

**Detailed Reasoning:** We examined all 18000 asynchronous simulation runs across all parameter combinations. Every single run reached a stable equilibrium where no agent could benefit from changing their ranking.

**Data Sources:** Convergence flags from all async simulation runs

**Implications:** Asynchronous updating provides a completely reliable mechanism for reaching consensus, with zero risk of cycles.

### Q2: Convergence Speed Scaling Laws  
**Question:** How does convergence time scale with network size?

**Answer:** Power-law scaling with density-dependent exponents:

- p=0.05: T_stop ~ n^1.17 (R²=0.847)
- p=0.1: T_stop ~ n^0.92 (R²=0.831)
- p=0.2: T_stop ~ n^0.91 (R²=0.896)
- p=0.3: T_stop ~ n^0.98 (R²=0.912)
- p=0.5: T_stop ~ n^1.13 (R²=0.94)
- p=0.7: T_stop ~ n^1.19 (R²=0.945)

**Detailed Reasoning:** Log-log regression reveals how convergence time scales with network size. Different densities show different scaling behaviors, with α values revealing computational complexity.

**Data Sources:** Convergence times and network sizes from async simulations

**Implications:** Values near α=1 suggest linear scaling (manageable), while α>1.5 indicates superlinear growth that could become prohibitive for large networks.

---

### Q3: Synchronous Fragility Analysis
**Question:** Which parameter regimes show sync convergence <50%?

**Answer:** 35 parameter combinations showed <50% convergence

**Detailed Reasoning:** Analyzed convergence rates across 150 parameter combinations. 35 showed fragility.

**Data Sources:** Convergence rates by (n,m,p) from sync simulations

**Implications:** Fragile regimes identify conditions where synchronous updating is unreliable, typically in sparse or complex networks.

---

### Q4: Cycle Length Distribution
**Question:** What cycle lengths occur when sync fails?

**Answer:** {'min': 2, 'median': 2.0, 'pct95': 2.0, 'max': 2, 'n_cycles': 4486}

**Detailed Reasoning:** Analyzed 4486 non-converged runs out of 18000 total sync runs.

**Data Sources:** Cycle lengths from non-converged sync simulations

**Implications:** Short cycles indicate simple oscillations rather than complex periodic behavior.

---

### Q5: Consensus Level Comparison
**Question:** What consensus levels do async vs sync achieve?

**Answer:** Async: 0.956, Sync: 0.939

**Detailed Reasoning:** Async achieved 0.956 average consensus, sync achieved 0.939.

**Data Sources:** Consensus fractions from all simulations

**Implications:** Higher async consensus suggests that self-paced updating leads to better coordination than simultaneous updates.

---

### Q6: Consensus vs Network Fragmentation
**Question:** Does fragmentation predict consensus levels?

**Answer:** {'correlation': 0.423, 'p_value': 0.0}

**Detailed Reasoning:** Pearson correlation between disagreement components and consensus across 36000 simulations.

**Data Sources:** Disagreement components and consensus fractions

**Implications:** Reveals whether network fragmentation patterns predict consensus outcomes.

---

### Q7: Ranking Distortion vs Consensus
**Question:** Does consensus require large ranking changes?

**Answer:** {'correlation': 0.014, 'p_value': 0.0073}

**Detailed Reasoning:** Correlation between consensus and ranking distortion across 36000 simulations.

**Data Sources:** Consensus fractions and Footrule shifts

**Implications:** Negative correlation indicates efficient consensus with minimal preference changes. Positive suggests consensus requires significant adjustment.

---

### Q8: Winner Stability Analysis
**Question:** How often does the plurality winner change?

**Answer:** {'overall': 0.533, 'async': 0.559, 'sync': 0.506}

**Detailed Reasoning:** Overall 53.3% of runs changed plurality winner. Async: 55.9%, Sync: 50.6%.

**Data Sources:** Winner-flip indicators from all simulations

**Implications:** High flip rates indicate dynamics significantly alter initial preferences rather than just organizing existing consensus.
